        <p>Roasea Bakes was started in 2017 by two home bakers and moms, that loved to bake. Our motto is to create the most delicious and memorable desserts and savouries for everyone to relish on. Our love for baking, decorating and making people say "yummy!" is why we do, what we do! Try our cakes and never go back to eating cakes anywhere else.</p>
        <p>Our cakes are customised and made to order, not just for flavours and Aesthetics, but for allergies, preferences and literally anything you can possibly dream of. You dream it, we create it. All our cakes and other bakes are available in eggless and Vegan options as well! So what are you waiting for? Have you tried our cakes yet?</p>
